# Experimental Tailscale PAM Module

This is a very very experimental Tailscale
[PAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM) module that allows you to SSH
using your Tailscale credentials. This is a response to
[tailscale/tailscale#3006](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/3006).

# <big> DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION YET </big>

This code is unaudited, not fully tested and is not known to be secure. This is
currently a proof of concept and is not made with the intent to be used yet.

Enjoy this preview into the future of auth.
